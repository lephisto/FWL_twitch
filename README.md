Requires FlyWithLua

Place twitchinfo_exporter in your FWL Scripts Directory.

Every Second it writes a file called xp11_stats.txt in your homedir, which you can include in an OBS Layer.

Current Limitations:

- Only works for Stock FMC and Zibo FMC.

Features being worked on:

- Support for Toliss A319 as well as Flightfactor Boeing and Airbus FMC
- Shiny HTML Overlay for OBS (Currently you just read Textinfo from a Textfile)


Remarks:

- Some stuff has been stolen from the Sample Scripts as well as the X-plane.org Forums.
